First HOLOLENS Hack

This projects uses hololens and unity to do color reassignment on live streamed video for people that are visually deficient. It was specifically designed for people lacking a specific cone, such as L (red), or S (blue), cone.

A video of partOne of the app is uploaded. It is a test that helps understand the type of vision deficiency a person has. 

partTwo of the app is a live stream using the web camera on the HoloLens. Since it uses the camera, we could not record this section, however, if you run the project in this project, you will be able to see the output of the stream after it has been color replaced.
